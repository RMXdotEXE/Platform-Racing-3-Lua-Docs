--- Player's current speed stat.
speed = 50

--- Player's current jump stat.
jump = 50

--- Player's current acceleration stat.
accel = 50

--- @param key Name of the metadata variable (the key)
--- @param value Value of the metadata variable
--- @usage setmetadata("coins", 10)
function setmetadata(key, value)
end

--- Gets a player metadata value with the specified key.
--- @param key The key (metadata variable name) that's used to find its value.
--- @param defaultValue The value to return if the searched key does not exists. By default no specific value is returned.
--- @return Returns the key's value. Returns defaultValue instead if the key isn't found.
--- @usage getmetadata("coins", 0)
function getmetadata(key, defaultValue)
end

--- Sends an alert popup to the player.
--- @param message The message to show the player.
function alert(message)
end

--- Sends a chat message to the player.
--- @param message The message to show to the player.

--- @usage chat('hello', 1922199)
function chat(message, color)
end

--- Teleports the player to the latest 'safe' block.
function safety()
end

--- Gives the player a laser gun item with specified settings.
--- Fields: ammo(int), reload(int), damage(int), recoil(float), knockback(float), sap(int), recovery(float), speed(float), range(float), rotation(String), repeat(float), phasing(float)

--- Teleports a player.
--- @param xpos (float) Teleport the player (xpos) blocks among the x-axis.
--- @param ypos (float) Teleport the player (ypos) blocks among the y-axis. A positive y teleports the player down.
--- @param keepvelocity (Boolean) Determines if the player keeps their velocity after teleportation. "false" by default.
function teleportto(xpos, ypos, keepvelocity)
end

--- Rotates a player to a given rotation at a given speed.
--- @param value (float) Sets the angle that the player will be rotated to in the nearest increment of 90.
--- @param amplifier (Number) Sets the speed amplifier of the rotation speed. For reference, Fez rotates at 10 amplifier.
function rotate(value, amplifier)
