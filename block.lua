--- Block related variables and functions
...

--- Current health of the block. The block is shattered if its health goes to zero or below.
health = 5

--- Is the block paused? Paused blocks can't move or change into different blocks.
paused = false

--- Can the block be moved
canmove = false

--- Tries to move the block to a specified direction. Move delay and the option to move the player can be passed, too.
--- @param direction The direction to move the block to.
--- @param moveDelay The delay of how long it takes to the block to be able to be moved again. By default 100 (ms).
--- @param movePlayer Is the player also moved? By default false.
--- @return Returns whatever the move was successful
--- @usage move("right")
--- @usage move("right", 200, true)
function move(direction, moveDelay, movePlayer)
end

--- Teleports the block in the given direction.
--- @param xpos (number) The amount to move the block among the x-axis.
--- @param ypos (number) The amount to move the block among the y-axis.
--- @param removecurrentblock (boolean) If the original block should be deleted among a successful teleportation. True by default.
--- @param removetargetspot (boolean) If true, the teleporting block teleports to its specified location and deletes the block if its spot is taken up. False by default.
function teleportto(xpos, ypos, removecurrentblock, removetargetspot)

--- Makes the block vanish and reappear later. The vanish delay can be passed.
--- @param time The amount of time until vanishing. Vanishes instantly by default.
function vanish(time)
end

--- Makes the block explode, damaging the player in the process.
--- @param damage The amount of damage done to the player. By default 1.
--- @param vel The strength of the impact that pushes the player. By default 0.3.
function explode(damage, vel)
end

--- Calculates crumble damage to the block depending on the player's velocity.
--- Causes the block's health to drop and shatters the block if it goes to zero or below.
--- @param particles Whatever to show particles when damage. By default true.
--- @param damageModifier Modifier used to calculate the velocity to damage. By default 100.
--- @param damagaThreshold The threshold for how high the damage has to be to damage this block. By default 7.
function crumble(particles, damageModifier, damagaThreshold)
end

--- Destroys the block by shattering it.
function shatter()
end

--- Finds another block by given coordinates. A player reference can be passed.
--- @param x How many blocks to the right the wanted block is?
--- @param y How many blocks downwards the wanted block is?
--- @param keepPlayerReference Is the player reference kept? By default false.
--- @return The found block as an object. Returns nil if a block isn't found.
--- @usage getblock(0,-1).shatter()
function getblock(x, y, keepPlayerReference)
end

--- Sets a metadata with a specified key-value pair to the block.
--- @param key Name of the metadata variable (the key)
--- @param value Value of the metadata variable
--- @usage setmetadata("coins", 10)
function setmetadata(key, value)
end

--- Gets a block metadata value with the specified key.
--- @param key The key (metadata variable name) that's used to find its value.
--- @param defaultValue The value to return if the searched key does not exists. By default no specific value is returned.
--- @return Returns the key's value. Returns defaultValue instead if the key isn't found.
--- @usage getmetadata("coins", 0)
function getmetadata(key, defaultValue)
end
